# AI Ads Zen Garden Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for the AI Ads Zen Garden project, which includes a centralized database structure for company information, an admin interface for managing this data, and dynamic category pages that display the information.

## Database Structure

### Company Interface
The database is structured around the `Company` interface, which includes:
- Basic information (id, name, description, url, logo)

- Error handling and backup functionality

## Admin Interface

The admin interface provides:
- A comprehensive form for managing all company details

## Category Pages

All category pages have been updated to:
- Use the centralized database through the CompanyContext

## UI Components

### Logo Component
A reusable Logo component has been created with:

- Optimization for high-quality display

### CompanyCard Component
An enhanced CompanyCard component provides:
